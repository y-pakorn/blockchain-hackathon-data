We present a solution to the problem of inflation for stablecoins. Our solution uses the popular OpenBook V2 smart contract (Solana program), which is a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX, available only in Solana. Our DeFi app controls the mint price Pm and redeem price Pr. If inflation rears its ugly head, Pm is increased automagically, not to earn profits for us, but rather to accumulate more backing. Our backing is initially USDC only which is also available in Solana. As people buy our stablecoin ROKS at a higher Pm, the system starts accumulating more USDC backing to achieve a redemption price Pr beyond parity. In time, Pr can approach Pm.

Antelao AI is building the asset layer for generative AI.

We believe that the advancement of generative AI is creating a novel category of AI assets. This includes LLM chatbots, characters, agents, customized image generative models, customized video generative models, customized music genarative models, etc. These assets stand apart from traditional AI models primarily because foundation models have significantly reduced the barriers to entry for creating them. We foresee a near future where individuals will be able to craft customized AI applications by simply providing text instructions, possibly along with examples of songs, images, or videos. These applications will cater to specific needs, such as enabling customers to hear a renowned singer perform any song of their choice.

These assets hold value for a variety of reasons. For instance, assets like LLM therapists and virtual travel agents generate direct value for the end consumer by providing personalized services. Meanwhile, the worth of some content-generative models is anchored in the value of the content they produce. For example, the value of an image-generative model tailored for a particular NFT collection is supported by the inherent value of that NFT collection. Additionally, these assets can derive significant value from intellectual property rights.

We have very strong AI capability. We have developed our own Large Language Models (LLMs), text-to-image, and text-to-game generative models.

i believe our product deserve visual over words. it'd be easier for you to check our demo video, landing page or download our app to feel it
words will hardly convey the beautiful ui/ux & abstraction we iterate over for a month. so instead i'll use this short description to tell you why we built this

humans lie to themselves all the time. we find excuses. 
we know what's good for us and yet we don't do it!
how do we flip the script?

most web2 app optimise our brain chemistry against us for their benefits. our attention is their product to sell
ascend does the opposite. its built to leverage your brain chemistry for you.

the app is built around routines. 
internet says it takes 21 days to build an habit and 90 days to make it a permanent lifestyle change. 
that's why our challenges default choices are 7 days (try) 30 days (create the habit) 90 days (make it permanent)

we repurpuse the proven web2 playbook. the habit loop (craving, cue, action, reward)
the social, feed, rng, notifications etc... don't optimise for your screentime but for your success

to enter the arena download the app, grab your solana wallet & answer these 4 questions
- what challenge?
- how long?
- solo or multi?
- how much you dare to stake?

example of challenges (daily actions)
- make your todo 
- complete your flashcards
- commit on github
- post on twitter
- post on farcaster
- block your youtube shorts
- cap your instagram hours per day to x
- daily gym
- custom wildcards
- etc ...

the goal is for you to connect anything you want seamlessly. 
if you connect your watch for daily gym, you won't even need to open the ascend app to confirm challenges. only to create & withdraw from them

when you set up a challenge or are challenged by a friend you're forced to make a conscious choice:
are you willing to put something at stake? do you really want to do it? if yes then trap your future self. put something meaningful at stake

why web3: easier for us to build. no stripe api. easier for us to leverage other protocols, expose our programs, share value and grow the pie 

when ponzi: at first we focus on organic slow growth. finding our core users. understanding our niche. ponzi skew metrics but helps grow. 
we cannot play with incentives before we built something that people genuinely use. or when the bear rises again, when the tides pull out, we'll be swimming naked

We support native recovery of SPL token accounts as well as stake accounts.

Furthermore there is a transaction builder that lets you execute arbitrary transactions (based on base64 encoded transactions, like solflare displays them). With this people can get assets locked in protocols, transfer cnfts, claim certain airdrops etc.
Features include: adding instructions (create token accounts, unbrick wallet if you bricked it yourself), changing accounts in the transactions, showing transaction simulations and accout changed.

The tool also allows for bricking a non-bricked wallet. This can be helpful when the private key was leaked as it prevents the attacker from doing certain things (anything that requires rent to be taken from the account directly). 
When at a later point in time the wallet can claim an airdrop (or whatever) it can be unbricked and the claim can be performed in the same transaction.

People are increasingly experiencing ad fatigue resulting in Click-through-Rates failing advertisers and ads efficiency falling ~15-20%  YoY. The ever increasing Cost per Click as well as Cost per Mile as online sales increase are making the final product sale more and more expensive. Retail Media Networks rule e-commerce and ads with 80% of market attributed to 4 companies resulting in a direct sales monopoly. But perhaps worst of all in an unprecedented mark-up in the history of sales, app stores take a 30% cut from all sales in the form of in-app purchases. This is unsustainable and a shift has already begun. Increasing as ad spend and market competition is driving sales to move beyond the online store shopping experiences that we all know to a growing 310 million social media users. Novel methods like influencer 
driven sales, direct in-post purchasing, and flash sales during streams are seeing traction. Through it all it has become apparent that direct sales remain the most cost effective option. However, as social media is gobbled up by the big players gaming remains the next biggest and a somewhat untapped market for direct sales.

That is why we built CLICKCRATE. An easy to use API and soon to come SDK that allows game developers to sell real world assets in their game in as little as two clicks. To start when simply request an API Key, create/register your in-game Point of Purchase (POP) through the create-clickcrate/register-clickcrate endpoints, and when you’re ready to start earning integrate the make-purchase api call into your the game logic associated with your Point of Purchase (POP) to allow users to purchase embedded real world assets.

While your CLICKCRATE is being created sellers are similarly creating/registering their products and once they are in our system our dynamic algorithm secured by blockchain and soon to be powered by AI will automatically find the perfect product to place in your Point of Purchase (POP). As the inventory for a product placed into your Point of Purchase (POP) sells you will receive earnings according to the fee that you specified during your CLICKCRATE’s creation.

Our groundbreaking project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by introducing a cutting-edge cryptocurrency cashback app, specifically built on the Solana blockchain. With the goal of popularizing Solana and integrating both Web 2 and Web 3 universes, our platform offers users the opportunity to earn Solana (SOL) tokens as rewards for their online purchases.

**Enhancing Accessibility to Solana:**

One of the primary objectives of our app is to enhance accessibility to Solana and foster widespread adoption of the blockchain technology. By providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for earning Solana tokens through everyday online transactions, we aim to demystify the process of acquiring and utilizing cryptocurrencies. This initiative not only expands the user base for Solana but also contributes to the broader crypto community.

**Empowering Financial Inclusion:**

Financial inclusion lies at the core of our mission. Through our app, users from diverse backgrounds and financial standings can participate in the crypto economy simply by engaging in their routine online shopping activities. This democratization of access to Solana rewards empowers individuals to take control of their financial futures and participate in the digital economy.

**Seamless Integration of Web 2 and Web 3:**

Our app serves as a bridge between the traditional web and the decentralized web. By seamlessly integrating cashback rewards in Solana tokens into the familiar framework of online shopping, we facilitate the transition for users from the traditional financial system to the decentralized ecosystem. This integration fosters a symbiotic relationship between Web 2 platforms and Solana, driving mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.

**Strategic Partnerships for Growth:**

We recognize the importance of strategic partnerships in achieving our goals. By collaborating with a diverse range of online retailers and e-commerce platforms, we ensure that users have access to a wide array of opportunities to earn Solana rewards. Additionally, partnerships with influencers, brands, and industry leaders amplify our reach and strengthen our position in the market, ultimately driving the popularity of Solana rewards.

**Educational Initiatives for User Empowerment:**

In addition to providing a platform for earning Solana rewards, we are committed to empowering users with knowledge about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Through educational initiatives, tutorials, and resources integrated within the app, we aim to demystify blockchain technology, promote financial literacy, and equip users with the tools they need to navigate the digital economy confidently.

**Advancing the Solana Ecosystem:**

Our project is not just about incentivizing online shopping; it's about driving the growth and adoption of the Solana ecosystem. By creating a use case for Solana tokens in everyday transactions, we contribute to the utility and value of the Solana blockchain. This, in turn, attracts developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to the Solana ecosystem, fostering innovation and driving its evolution as a leading blockchain platform.

**Introduction of Platform Token:**

Furthermore, we have plans to introduce a platform token within our ecosystem to incentivize transactions and participation. By offering additional rewards and benefits through our native token, we aim to further incentivize engagement and foster a vibrant and active community within our platform.

In conclusion, our Solana Rewards app represents a transformative step towards popularizing Solana, integrating Web 2 with Web 3, and empowering individuals to participate in the digital economy. With a strategic vision, user-centric approach, and commitment to education and inclusivity, we believe our project has the potential to revolutionize the way people engage with cryptocurrencies and contribute to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.",2024-04-02T15:11:50.717Z,0,false,false,"[""DeFi & Payments"",""Consumer Apps""]",Brazil,https://github.com/WesleyBispo/testeWeb3,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

Imagine this: instead of seeking a single donation of 200 million VND, we issue 10,000 EcoPanel cNFTs at just 20,000 VND each.

17,2,eco-planet,Eco Planet,"We are a team of crypto-enthusiasts, which worried about the ecological situation on Earth. 

Nowadays around the world, people have a lot of ideas about how to reduce the amount of plastic, how to make goods with eco-materials, how to protect animals etc.

But these solutions have one big problem - these activities do not attract enough people at least because they are mostly voluntary

And we can introduce new solution with the usage of blockchain and cryptocurrency how to attract people to reduce the amount of plastic around the Earth. It’s similar to **play-to-earn** business model, where people will have a worthy reward for their contribution to cleaning the planet from pollution.

Main problem

The problem of environmental pollution is becoming more and more urgent every year. Pollution is killing, changing the cycle of the seasons and bringing the possibility of disasters across the world closer. 

So, in the last few years across a lot of countries in Europe and the USA appeared automatic machines which allow you to put plastic bottles inside and receive rewards for recycling. The reward is a certain amount of money which you can spend in the shop or market where the machine is located.

Ok, but what product we are offering?

We have developed an application using NEAR smart-contracts (moving to Solana blockchain now) in order to enable enthusiasts and volunteers around the world to receive additional rewards for cleaning the Earth and at the same time popularize cryptocurrencies (and tokens on Solana blockchain) among a new generation.

A feature and one of the main advantages is that we can use already existing plastic recycling machines by adding just a QR code at the bottom of the check they give you.

By handing over bottles, users receive a cryptocurrency that they can withdraw at the end of the season.

At the same time, we offer gamification including a general table of users, a social rating, as well as multipliers with which users can earn more by moving up in the rating table.

Each season continues for at least a month, and users can complete unique seasonal and weekly tasks, by completing which the user can receive either additional coins, social points or other interesting rewards.

Innovation:

We are using blockchain to solve environmental problems, as well as popularizing the crypto industry through socially significant activities. A large number of governments are highly-interested in plastic recycling and our project has a potential chance of getting funding as an initiative to speed up and improve this process.

Future plans:

- Completely move to Solana blockchain due to
    - low commissions and fast transactions
    - better development experience and ecosystem, stable SDKs and and more convenient tools for frontend
- Test our product on first users in Kyiv, now signing an agreement on cooperation with recycling company to test our product",2024-04-01T21:24:23.559Z,0,false,false,"[""Consumer Apps"",""Infrastructure""]",Ukraine,https://github.com/Algoritm211/eco-planet-renaissance/,null,2,null,null,null,null,null

The impact bot allows any token on the Jupiter strict allow list to be immediately converted into an environmental impact via our smart contract. Each time the smart contract is hit with a payment from any token on the allowlist, it triggers a carbon credit retirement through the ecoLedger. This triggers the issuance of an Impact Certificate to the address that sent the funds, verifying the size of their environmental impact.

This is a smart contract that any application can utilize to incorporate environmental impacts into their apps. For example, games can have in-game impact with their native token, payment platforms can incorporate carbon options, and DePin projects can go carbon neutral with their native token in real time.

Details: Our dApp provides eSealing and Hashing and Time Stamping of the certificates & documents on the chain for the certificates & degrees issued by the University, and for transparent verification on chain by 3rd Party Verification Companies and by US/EU/AUS/NZ Universities: This will ease the pain of Universities to accept only genuine students, in a faster and cost-effective manner. Hence our solution (www.edubukeseal.org) on the Blockchain is gaining traction in the market by Universities in India and by 3rd party transcript verification service provider in the US.
This dApp will be a full blown scalable version of the CV & Resume being recorded on the Blockchain where every line mentioned in the CV will be clickable and a link to that information stored publicly on the Blockchain.

The complete Edubuk profile of the candidate on the Blockchain will have the following features recorded on the chain:

1.) Learning Medium & Resources
2.) Credits & Grades
3.) Academic Certificates
4.) Professional Certificates (Work Experience of Corporate)
5.) Subjects, Courses & Projects Studied
6.) Interests, Hobbies
7.) Online Education Courses completed
8.) Online Skill Based Courses completed.

This dApp will have 2 layers:

1.) eSeal Layer: to Record the Certificates and Transcripts on the Blockchain: for University & Students and for HRs & Employees in Corporates.

2.) Verification Layer: to Verify the already stored Certificates and Transcripts on the Blockchain by University Admins or by HRs in Corporates.

Once this profile is created (customized Edubuk profile for each candidate: freshers, students and employees), then we will use AI (Artificial Intelligence), NLP algorithm to sift through the Edubuk profile of the candidate having all the information about his/her academics, skills, credits, grades, previous employment history (if any) and then this information will be used to map it with the most relevant job openings out there in the market. Hence, each potential employee will get to see only most relevant job openings suiting his Edubuk profile and each HR in the corporate will be able to see only the most relevant candidate which matches the skills and requirements as per the Job Description of the Relevant Job opening.

Hence, this will be an AI driven Transcript & CV Recording and Verification Protocol on the Blockchain.

One of them is participants decide how much of the pool will be distributed to how many people. Another one is, participants can create their own lotteries! (Great benefit for Youtubers, influencers, and fundraisers etc.).

This is how does it work, people send solana to each lottery session to join. Along with their solana they cast a vote between 0 and 100 percent for payout ratio. Let's say on average payout ratio is decided at 20 percent, it means that randomly chosen 20 percent of the participants will receive 99 percent of the lottery pool and 1 percent goes to us. 

People will receive this prize according to their contribution. Meaning, if a ticket worth of 10 solana wins 5 solana, than a ticket worth of 20 solan wins 10 solana. 

This is all possible thanks to Solana's super fast and cost efficient infrastructure. Participants can start joining with as little as 0.50$ worth of Solana.

Introduction:
In the bustling streets of Sierra Leone, finding a place to call home is more than just a transaction—it's a journey filled with challenges and dreams. Enter Fen, a pioneering real estate platform on a mission to revolutionize access to housing and empower individuals to fulfill their dreams of homeownership.

Identifying the Problem:
Fen's story begins with a realization: traditional real estate methods in Sierra Leone are plagued by high costs, limited transparency, and a lack of personalized assistance. The founders witnessed firsthand the frustrations faced by individuals and families as they navigated the complex and often daunting process of finding a home.

The Birth of Fen:
Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to making a difference, the founders of Fen set out to create a solution. They envisioned a platform that would leverage technology to streamline the property search process while maintaining the expertise of real estate agents. Thus, Fen was born—a beacon of hope in an otherwise challenging landscape.

The Fen Experience:
At Fen, we believe that everyone deserves access to affordable, transparent, and convenient housing options. Our platform empowers users to browse through a wide range of properties, negotiate rents directly with landlords, and even split costs with roommates—all with just a few taps on their phone.

Impact and Growth:
Since our inception, Fen has made waves in the real estate industry, garnering praise from users and investors alike. We've seen steady growth in user sign-ups and property transactions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. With strategic partnerships and collaborations, we've expanded our reach and solidified our position as a leader in the market.

The Future of Fen:
As we look to the future, Fen remains committed to our mission of empowering dreams. We're continuously innovating and adapting to meet the evolving needs of our users. With the support of investors who share our vision, we're poised to take Fen to new heights and make an even greater impact on the lives of individuals and families across Sierra Leone and beyond.

Conclusion:
In a world where finding a home can feel like an insurmountable challenge, Fen offers hope. We believe that by harnessing the power of technology and community, we can create a brighter future for all.

420,2,hermes-protocol,Hermes Protocol,"Hermes Protocol: A Decentralized Social Graph on Solana

Introduction:
Hermes Protocol is a groundbreaking decentralized social graph protocol built natively on the Solana blockchain. We believe that the future of crypto adoption lies in non-speculative use cases, leveraging blockchain technology as a global state machine and a solution to the double-spend problem. Hermes Protocol aims to provide users with a decentralized alternative to traditional walled-garden social graphs like Facebook and TikTok, offering true free speech backed by math and fair compensation for user-generated content.

Problem Statement:
In the era of deepfakes and AI-generated content, the authenticity and trustworthiness of online information are under severe threat. While AI can convincingly manipulate images, videos, and text, it currently cannot break the mathematical principles of public-private key encryption, which form the foundation of blockchain technology. This presents a unique opportunity to leverage the power of decentralized systems, like Solana, to create a social graph that is resistant to the dangers of AI-generated misinformation and disinformation.

Traditional social media platforms, operating as walled gardens, offer little to no compensation for users and minimal ad revenue sharing. Moreover, they lack true free speech, as they are not backed by the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology. The rise of AI and deepfakes exacerbates these issues, making it increasingly difficult for users to trust the content they consume and engage in meaningful interactions without being overwhelmed by intrusive communication and spam.

Hermes Protocol aims to address these challenges by building a decentralized social graph on Solana, leveraging its global state machine capabilities and encryption algorithms. By utilizing public-private key encryption, Hermes Protocol ensures that all interactions and content are securely attributed to verified identities, making it nearly impossible for AI to impersonate users or manipulate the social graph.

Furthermore, by integrating payments directly into the protocol, Hermes Protocol creates an economic incentive structure that discourages spam and encourages high-quality content creation. Users can impose costs on communication, such as requiring micropayments for access to their inbox or content, effectively filtering out unwanted interactions and ensuring that legitimate users can engage freely without being drowned out by noise.

The combination of cryptographically verifiable identities and built-in payment mechanisms creates a powerful deterrent against AI-generated misinformation and disinformation. Bad actors attempting to introduce fake content under a verified identity risk severe reputational damage, as their actions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. This accountability creates a strong incentive for users to maintain the integrity of their digital identities and the content they share.

Solution:
Hermes Protocol's solution revolves around on-chain identities defined by unique usernames paired with SPL-NFTs. These identities form the foundation for all on-chain interactions within the protocol. Key features include:

1. On-chain metadata updates by owners, allowing users to control their profile picture, header, description, privacy status, subscription status, and subscription requirements.
2. On-chain communication, supporting public posts, encrypted DMs, and email-like protocols. This ensures that all interactions are securely stored on the blockchain.
3. Monthly subscriptions to access private content, facilitated by delegating USDC to a PDA (Program Derived Address) controlled by the recipient user, which can be called via a public cron job.
4. User interactions such as reactions (supporting ANY emoji), replies, bookmarks, and more, all recorded on-chain.
5. Follow functionality with privacy controls, allowing users to follow other profiles, request to follow private profiles, and approve or reject follow requests.
6. Fair and decentralized profile minting through public auctions, minimizing front-running and ensuring equal access to profile origination.
7. Integration with new social platforms as a universal social login, similar to ""Login with Google"" in the web2 world.
8. Rich post content support, including compressed images, videos, and GIFs, in addition to plain text.

By leveraging PDAs and other Solana-specific features, Hermes Protocol ensures that all interactions and data are securely stored on-chain, providing a tamper-proof and censorship-resistant social graph.

Future Roadmap:
1. Native mobile support, prioritizing the Solana Saga mobile stack for seamless user experience.
2. Event-driven pipeline for on-chain user activity (mints, posts, reactions, etc.) to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
3. Optimized timeline and resource loading for a more responsive user interface.
4. Frames support, similar to Farcaster, enabling native Solana dApp integration into posts and exploring referral fee incentives for sharing and promoting content.
5. Token incentive system, inspired by Steemit, rewarding early users for minting, posting, and referring new users, with post rewards based on viewership and engagement.

While the current implementation is a proof of concept and may have rough edges, the team is committed to refining and expanding the protocol to create a more equitable, user-centric, and secure social media landscape.",2024-04-08T00:30:50.788Z,0,false,false,"[""DAOs & Communities"",""Consumer Apps""]",United States,https://github.com/solcialid/hermes,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

1. Attract people from other ecosystems to the Solana community through the Hi! Mobile app.
2. Create an additional filter for receiving a drop from the project (or it can be a multiplier).
3. Notify users about crypto events from Solana, or about other events (promotional posts). (both online and offline)

The idea is built on the daily routine of every person, Good morning and Good night.

In the cryptosphere, this is the most relevant, because some users in chats, apart from ""Gm, Gn, Hi"" do not write anything else. From this comes the main idea - to give users the opportunity to receive rewards or additional bonuses from ecosystem projects thanks to such simple things.

Our thesis is simple: in today’s attention-driven economy, the most engaging thing for people is other people.

One that will inevitably attract influencers and celebrities into creating their own official tokens that represent them.

However, launching your own token comes with a slew of challenges. Legal implications, fair transparent distribution, ensuring reasonable liquidity so the token can be traded on the open market. You’ll need some degree of technical knowledge and then you’ll need easy consensus that this is the official token for you. Because there will be copycats.

Our solution is mE.T.F. Best-in-class legal terms and disclaimers, standardized process for transparent launching tokens. A bonding curve mechanism which allows anyone to start a token for just a few dollars. Zero technical knowledge, and consensus built from Twitter authentication.

MMOSH is a Solana protocol for creating and joining connected crypto communities mediated by AI. 

The protocol handles personal identity, attribution for the distribution of royalties and other incentives, access to token-gated communities, and the management of bonding curves and liquidity pools for creating and swapping community coins. This is done through four token primitives.

There are four contextual roles in every transaction, the ecosystem, the creator, agents and enjoyers. Most users will take on different roles in each transaction, with the exception of the ecosystem.

Nothing in the protocol is wallet-bound. Tokens can be moved from wallet to wallet. Royalties follow the tokens, not a fixed wallet address.

Our key technology is a way of ""imprinting"" tokens with data from other tokens at the time of minting.

The primary initial user interface is Telegram. Users can send tokens, mint, swap etc. by communicating in plain language with an AI bot. The AI bot also administers Telegram groups for new on-chain dynamics.

Users can receive their private key through a Telegram mini-app, import it into a separate standalone wallet (such as Phantom, Solflare or backpack) and connect to our web app. With the web app, the user can retrieve all tokens, all the media shared in a token-gated group and receive summaries of group conversations from the AI bot even if they lose their Telegram account.

This allows us to leverage a powerful, though centralized, group messaging system without compromising censorship resistance, composability or permissionlessness.",2024-04-09T00:07:26.913Z,0,false,true,"[""DAOs & Communities"",""Consumer Apps""]",United States,https://github.com/mmosh-pit/,null,5,"{""name"":""Honorable Mention - DAOs & Communities"",""type"":""HONORABLE_MENTION"",""track"":""DAOs & Communities"",""amount"":0}",Honorable Mention - DAOs & Communities,HONORABLE_MENTION,DAOs & Communities,0

Owl Network is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain that aims to capture, integrate, and provide high-value Point of Interest POI data to enable the development of location-centric Web3 applications and services. The network leverages a unique combination of offline shared Power bank stations, known as Owl Stations, and blockchain technology to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital realm.
Building on a Solid Foundation
Owl Network is built on top of the Solana blockchain, which offers high performance, scalability, and low transaction costs. Solana's architecture enables fast and efficient processing of transactions, making it suitable for handling the data-intensive operations required by Owl Network.
Owl Stations
Owl Stations form the physical infrastructure of the Owl Network. These stations combine the functionality of charging banks and network nodes, serving as data capture points and enabling users to interact with the network. Owl Stations are strategically deployed in various locations to maximize the coverage and quality of the collected POI data.
Data Capture and Integration
Owl Stations are equipped with sensors and devices that capture location-based information, such as GPS coordinates, Wi-Fi signals, and Bluetooth beacons. The captured data is then securely transmitted to the Owl Network, where it undergoes validation and integration processes. The network employs various data validation techniques, including consensus algorithms and data quality checks, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the POI data.
Data Storage and Indexing
Overview 4 part 1

The validated POI data is stored on the Solana blockchain using efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Owl Network leverages advanced geospatial technologies, such as geohashing and spatial indexing, to enable fast and efficient querying and retrieval of location-based information. This optimized storage and indexing approach allows for seamless integration with location- based services and applications.
Smart Contracts and Applications
Owl Network provides a framework for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize the captured POI data to create location-centric applications. These applications can range from location-based services and geospatial analytics to proximity-based interactions and more.
Incentivization and Tokenomics
Owl Network incorporates an incentivization mechanism to encourage participation and contribution to the network. Users who provide valuable POI data through Owl Stations are rewarded with tokens or other incentives. The network's tokenomics model is designed to ensure the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem, aligning the interests of users, developers, and stakeholders.",2024-04-09T06:36:07.018Z,0,false,false,"[""DePin"",""Consumer Apps""]",Hong Kong,https://github.com/owlnetwork-xyz/core.git,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

Problem Addressed:

In regions devastated by war and conflict, traditional methods of aid distribution often face significant challenges. Limited access to banking services, lack of transparency, and risks of fraud undermine relief efforts, leaving affected populations without crucial support. ReliefLink steps in to address these issues head-on.

Solution Offered:

Supporting War-Torn Regions: ReliefLink serves as a dedicated crowdfunding platform, allowing users to directly contribute to campaigns aimed at assisting war-affected populations and refugees. By facilitating targeted donations, ReliefLink enables individuals to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need.

Enhanced Transparency: The platform ensures complete transparency by leveraging blockchain technology to display the transaction history of campaign wallet addresses. Contributors can track their donations every step of the way, fostering trust and accountability in the relief process.

Seamless and Secure Transactions: Operating even in the most challenging conditions, ReliefLink is designed to process transactions reliably, even during communication disruptions and power outages. By providing a seamless and secure channel for donations, the platform empowers users to support relief efforts with confidence.

Automated Validation: ReliefLink utilizes smart contracts to automate transaction validation, ensuring that funds reach their intended recipients swiftly and securely. This minimizes the risk of fraud and misappropriation, safeguarding donations and maximizing their impact on the ground.

Media Storage: To preserve crucial documentation and aid efforts, ReliefLink stores all photos on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), distributing files across a network of nodes. This decentralized approach reduces the risk of data loss due to a single point of failure, particularly vital in conflict zones.",2024-04-08T15:07:02.693Z,0,false,false,"[""DAOs & Communities"",""Consumer Apps""]",India,https://github.com/caterpillhub/relief-link,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

It activates idle assets and hardware on Solana and large-scale DePIN networks through an innovative restaking mechanism, providing a robust and mature unifying trust layer for emerging DePIN networks and related applications on Solana to better serve real users. 

Despite the promising potential of DePINs, one significant obstacle hindering their widespread adoption is the issue of trust in service quality. DePIN networks usually combine token staking and physical hardware services to form the trust layer of the network, ensuring the quality of network services. When service providers' hardware services fail to meet the network's requirements, the network penalizes the service providers' staked token. However, for an emerging DePIN network, building a trust layer is not easy, especially when their native tokens for trust layer governance are not yet issued (such as in the DePIN testnet phase), concentrated in the hands of a few service providers (when DePIN nodes are not widely distributed and diversified enough), or the value is insufficient to cover potential losses for users (when the market value of DePIN native tokens is smaller than the service value).

Repl aims to build a unifying trust layer for DePIN networks using SOL restaking. When SOL tokens are restaked on Repl, emerging DePIN networks on Solana can leverage Repl as their trust layer, providing trust for their DePIN services. Its trust layer governance and reward mechanism can be implemented using SOL. This creates stickiness for DePIN projects to keep building on Solana and enhances capital efficiency for SOL token holders.

And influencers don’t have any way to truthfully know the sales they bring to a brand, unless they are told by the brand, and it’s in the brand's interest to downplay the sales.

Satik helps brands reward influencers on both visibility and sales. Satik can help brands transparently reward influencers for sales they bring. Influencers can also be transparently rewarded in Solana for views they garner for the agreed content. 

This can help smaller and foreign content creators and brands collaborate without trusting each other explicitly.

21,2,smart-contracts-to-supply-medical-prescriptions,SMART CONTRACTS TO SUPPLY MEDICAL PRESCRIPTIONS,"As firm believers of people´s right to health access and having experienced several issues ourselves, we have identified that there is an existing necessity for efficient prescription distribution among users of the health system. 
In Colombia, although there are entities in charge of distributing medicines to users, there are multiple difficulties such as the speed of order processing, prescription availability at designated drugstores, users moving to distant places for prescription collection, cost of transport, among others. Existing software development tools are quite expensive and require high human processing intervention, besides, prescription inventory is a big issue given that the entities providing medicines to users (drugstores) at times do not have availability of some medicines in a specific store but have lots of this same medicine at some other location, making it difficult for users to get their prescription whenever they need it.
Our main purpose is to offer a user-based solution mediated by AI & Smart Contracts. This solution considers the most urgent user needs such as:

1 Faster process: With smart contracts, process speed and privacy, increase, creating a better experience for patients and less complaints against HCPs.
2 Cost-Effective inventories: Having the necessary medicine inventory according to patients´ needs, helps improve inventory quality and is cost-efficient for designated drugstores. 
3 Forecasts: Having smart contracts allows stakeholders to:
•	HCPs: have a more accurate forecast of medicine cost and follow-up of patient needs. 
•	Designated drugstores: improve inventory cost, allowing the company to send the exact amount of medicine needed in different locations. Also, in case medicines are not available, medicine can be sent to the patient´s address. 
•	Customer Experience: Patients will have better processes and in case the patient suffers an accident, doctors can access patients´ records to check all their medical history. This will help doctors to prescribe or not, according to the patient´s existing medical conditions. 
SOLUTION 
Creating smart contracts for medicine will solve the issues for the actors involved in the process such as:
•	Better process time for the patient to receive the medicine prescribed.
•	Better cost inventory processes for the designated drugstores
•	Better customer experience for HCP´s patients

604,2,solana-matcher,Solana Matcher ,"There's a surge in interest among businesses and founders looking to build on Solana's infrastructure. However, navigating the landscape to find the right team for specific projects isn't always straightforward - especially for newcomers. Recognizing this challenge, we're excited to build Solana Matcher—a on-chain digital personas, hiring and leads generation platform tailored for the Solana Community.

Solana Matcher is designed to empower the Solana community by providing a solution for connecting businesses, founders, developers and community members. Users can easily connect their various social media profiles (linkedin, wallets,  X, github, discord, blogs and more) and upload resumes.

Here's how it works: Anyone interested in building on Solana can utilize Solana Matcher platform to describe their business needs and project requirements just pasting the description into our UI. Our LLM-powered system then goes to work, matching the best teams based on skillsets, experience, and project fit. From there, we facilitate connections and collaboration, ensuring that every project gets the right team to bring it to life. Additionally, Solana Matcher serves as a lead generation platform, connecting businesses with top-tier talent and vice versa, thus fostering long-term relationships beyond just hiring needs.

Solana Matcher incentivizes Solana Community members to participate actively in the platform by rewarding them with a portion of the pool for connecting their social media profiles and uploading their current resumes. This process is integrated into the platform's architecture, with smart contracts on the Solana automatically allocating rewards to users based on their contributions.

Furthermore, Solana Matcher employs a payment model for business owners seeking to be matched with the best Solana community members. Instead of introducing its own token, Solana Matcher operates exclusively in SOL. Business owners make matching requests by paying in SOL directly to the platform. These SOL payments are then directed to the Treasury, a designated smart contract.

The Treasury serves as a communal fund where all SOL payments from matching requests are collected. Periodically, the Treasury distributes these accumulated funds among users who have shared their achievements within the Solana ecosystem. We want to introduce a share-to-earn SoFi model. This distribution is executed programmatically via smart contracts. 

Solana Matcher also offers a range of features to enhance the user experience:

Track Matches, Applications, Interactions:

Dive into your personalized dashboard for a comprehensive view of your Solana projects hunting journey. Monitor the number of job matches, keep tabs on your applications, and see how many recruiters have engaged with your AI-powered persona.

No more CV updates:

Solana Matcher Social Media Profile sync feature keeps your resume fresh and up-to-date. We automatically fetch your most recent achievements, accolades, and professional updates from your social media profiles, ensuring your CV is consistently updated. This means that even if you're not actively looking for a Solana project, your newly acquired skills can potentially match you with better opportunities.

This enables developers to quickly perform a security audit on their smart contracts so find vulnerabilities and fix them and prevent common known hacks, thereby making the ecosystem super secure.
The best part about this tool is, we used an open source LLM and finetuned it with a dataset, the tool can be downloaded on the user's PC or a free colab account and used. This is decentralization at it's finest.

We have finetuned an open source model - Mistral7B with a custom dataset to be able to detect smart contract security issues in Solana code.

We have OPEN SOURCED our fine-tuned model on huggingface - https://huggingface.co/ArmurAI/solana_smart_contract_auditor

In addition, I issued cnfts to all chapter 2 holders and established saga2HOME on TG to help everyone improve their security awareness and provide the latest airdrop consultation. Increases user stickiness and prevents users from accidentally losing it.

If I get funding I will create a full time working group. Currently, everyone in our DAO community is part-time, except me.
Our current traffic data in the Asia-Pacific region is 3,000+ monthly visits, helping saga2 to close 100+ transactions. When I establish a full-time work group, I will double this number within 3 months and 5 times after 1 year. Our project may seem small, but I feel it is very important! Because many new users will be defrauded inadvertently and lost permanently. With our presence, we will help new users solve the problems of pre-sales consultation and purchase on the depin track and getting started with web3 technology. It will also allow new and old users to find Solana’s home! Discover the charm of Solana!

Second: We also found a local team and reached a strategic cooperation. It is a hardware wallet in the depin track. We will copy the sales model of saga2 and improve and innovate it. This is why I need this grant! I believe we will create our own depinDAO community model in the future. We will help all hardware project parties in the sol chain ecosystem. Do pre-sales and after-sales service! This is a great thing! Not only has the hardware marketing been done well, but also the cultural popularization of Solana has been done well! We are all doing this now! I hope this funding will increase our impact and help more people!

I have mentioned in the budget proposal that we can popularize new users through hardware bridges. Achieve the effect of attracting new people. Then join our TG group and do a good job in user tracking and maintenance. In this way, our community grows in every project and helps every project party. Because as far as I know, the project side is really not good at pre-sales consultation and after-sales maintenance. Our goal is to be a third-party project provider for the overall pre-sales consultation and after-sales service of Solana Ecosystem! Hope official support!

We love Solana! If we didn't get funding, we would have done it ourselves!

If the current price ever drops 5% (or any percent you chose) below your position's peak price, your position's tokens are automatically sold.  This is not the same as a Limit Order!

Trailing Stop Losses Lock in your Gains and Limits Your Losses, but there's plenty of other kinds of trades the SolSentry team is planning to implement, like the Dip Auto Buyer, the Wave Rider, and cool features like the Wallet Importer.

In this system, users can hide text or program triggering codes in the images they print as NFTs, enable all NFTs in a collection to dynamically communicate with each other, or create many creative development tools using the infrastructure.

works by using a unique supervisory mechanism that matches the pixel values of images with their ASCII values to load data hidden inside the images. This mechanism allows all images within a collection to communicate, creating a kind of ""Internet of NFT"". The developed algorithm works in synchronization with the algorithm that performs the steganography process.

The algorithm can process a packet of information or program trigger data ranging from 4000 to 10000 characters and convert it into a 7 to 21-bit representation and 3 keys. When the 21-bit data is sent to the blockchain, a copy of the content is embedded in the pixels of the image with a specific encryption. These representations work with blockchain confirmation, so that triggering scenarios of data packets or application transactions can happen again.

This technology is designed as a developer tool that can be used in many areas such as data security and monitoring, automatic triggering and contract execution, tokenization and licensing, data verification and identity management, distributed transaction optimization, alternative blockchain communication module, as well as creating triggers to run other algorithms with the collective action of a collection of NFTs.

By automatically minting NFTs for each transaction on platforms like WooCommerce, Tagacy revolutionizes the way businesses interact with customers, offering unique digital assets that capture the essence of every transaction.

We asked one simple question: How can we use NFTs in our daily life without a huge change management?

The answer was also a question: How about getting an NFT in return of every purchase? Food, clothing, car, house, yacht...

It's our goal at Tagacy to bring NFT usage to everyday life through customer, client, student or subscriber journey. Every transaction will give the buyer/customer a unique and non-fungible asset. It's much more valueable and easy to use then conventional invoices or receipts. Think of buying a ticket or getting a training certificate or donating money to charity organization, then getting an NFT in return. Tagacy will give this infrastructure to the businesses and intitutions.

Our target customers will be businesses as we built our income model based on transaction fee. Target audience to engage with Tagacy is the average consumer who does not have to have expertise on NFTs.


Tagacy - Revolutionizing Transactions with NFTs
In the dynamic landscape of modern commerce, differentiation and customer engagement are paramount. Tagacy introduces a groundbreaking solution by seamlessly integrating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into everyday transactions. Through this innovative system, businesses can enhance transparency, customer engagement, and value creation.
The core concept of Tagacy revolves around automating the minting of NFTs for each transaction conducted through ecommerce platforms, ERP, invoicing and sales tools. This approach revolutionizes the way businesses interact with customers, offering them unique digital assets that encapsulate the essence of every transaction.

Key Features:
Automatic NFT Generation: Tagacy streamlines the process by automatically generating NFTs for every successful transaction, eliminating manual intervention. 
Customizable Metadata: Businesses can enrich NFTs with customized metadata, including transaction details and product descriptions, to enhance their value and authenticity. 
Blockchain Integration: Leveraging blockchain technology ensures the security, immutability, and transparency of transaction records, fostering trust between businesses and customers. 
Customer Engagement: Tagacy enhances customer engagement by providing them with unique digital assets, fostering a sense of ownership and loyalty. 
Insights: The system offers valuable analytics and insights into transactional data, empowering businesses to understand customer behavior and preferences. 

Technical Architecture:
Tagacy's technical architecture comprises several components, including:

Integration Layer: Interfaces with existing transaction platforms, such as WooCommerce, to capture transaction data.
NFT Generation Module: Automatically generates NFTs based on transaction data and customizable metadata.
Blockchain Interface: Interacts with a chosen blockchain network (e.g., Solana) to mint NFTs securely and transparently.
APIs and SDKs: Provides APIs and SDKs for easy integration with third-party systems and customization according to business needs.

Below we share Tagacy's Woocommerce developer API as a sample to demonstrate the end-to-end process. 
The merchant connects with the store URL and credentials to activate Tagacy along with crypto wallet.
 After comleting the setup, merchant can start utilizing the powerful features of Tagacy. 
Upon the successful transaction, Tagacy automatically creates NFT using merchant's wallet then transfers it to the customer's wallet.
All the required information (customer wallet address, NFT visuals, features etc) will be gathered from merchant's website and order metadata.
With the transferred NFT, the customer becomes the sole owner of the digital copy of the product or service s/he purchased. 

Use Cases:

E-commerce: Tagacy revolutionizes e-commerce transactions by providing customers with NFTs representing their purchases, enhancing authenticity and ownership.
Retail: Retail businesses can leverage Tagacy to create digital receipts in the form of NFTs, offering customers a novel and secure way to verify their purchases.
Hospitality: Hotels and restaurants can use Tagacy to create unique digital souvenirs for guests, immortalizing their experiences and fostering brand loyalty.
Authentication: Tagacy extends its utility to authentication use cases such as university diplomas and training certificates. By minting NFTs for these credentials, Tagacy ensures their authenticity, tamper-proof nature, and easy verification. This feature enhances trust and transparency in credentialing processes, mitigating the risk of fraud and counterfeit credentials.
Event Organizing: Event organizers can utilize Tagacy to issue NFT-based tickets and access passes, enhancing security and preventing ticket fraud. Attendees receive unique NFTs representing their tickets, providing a seamless and secure entry process while offering collectible memorabilia from the event.
Collectibles: Tagacy enables the creation and trading of digital collectibles, such as artwork, music, or virtual assets. Artists and content creators can mint NFTs for their creations, allowing fans and collectors to purchase, own, and trade unique digital collectibles securely on the blockchain.

Tagacy represents a paradigm shift in the way businesses interact with customers, offering a novel and innovative solution to enhance transparency, engagement, and value creation. By harnessing the power of NFTs, Tagacy empowers businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive market landscape while providing customers with unique digital assets that capture the essence of their interactions.

In that moment of inspiration, a vision for a radically different NFT landscape took shape—one where digital assets would leap from the static to the dynamic, engaging users in a whole new way. Just three days later, on February 7th, we unveiled our proof of concept/MVP to a vibrant community of like-minded builders. The response was electric. Our project resonated deeply, capturing the imagination of our community as the dream of interactive NFT experiences took flight.

Embark on a thrilling journey with TangTalk, where static digital assets are reimagined into dynamic, interactive experiences. This isn’t just a vision—it’s a reality, brought to life by the team at TangTalk, who are reshaping the digital realm. Imagine NFTs that go beyond mere visuals to offer immersive, engaging interactions that pull you into a vibrant digital world.

At the heart of this digital metamorphosis is TangTalk, a platform that’s transcending traditional boundaries. Here, we’re not just redefining digital assets; we’re revolutionizing the way users connect. Starting with a simple yet innovative concept—a pager-style party chat NFT—we've evolved, driven by the imagination and support of a visionary community, into a dynamic, interactive platform that challenges the status quo.

Our journey has been marked by significant milestones, including successful launches on both PulseChain (PLS) and Chia, demonstrating our commitment to cross-chain functionality and the robustness of our underlying technology. Through these achievements, we've not only showcased the potential for NFTs to offer more than static art but also proven the viability of our decentralized, peer-to-peer network and the innovative L2 Cache system. This technology ensures seamless interactions and sets the foundation for future digital explorations.

As we venture further, expanding TangTalk’s capabilities to include gaming, integrated exchanges, and community-driven projects, we continue to solidify our position at the forefront of the interactive digital landscape. Our current presence on PLS and Chia, coupled with successful demonstrations of our tech and principles, paves the way for an ambitious future where blockchain communities are interconnected, and digital assets become gateways to unparalleled interactive experiences.

However, if one player thinks that the other cheated, the chain is used as an arbitrator between the players. The chain then declares the honest player as the winner, sending them the funds.

As Robfly Software Company, we have developed Videlifedao, a decentralized live conference and recording system. Built on WebRTC technology, this system offers advanced features for managing live broadcasts. Behind the scenes, WebRTC is used for encoding live streams, while Meupwallet DAO is integrated for recording private decisions.

Meupwallet DAO enables users to sign decisions with their personal private keys and then send these decisions to smart contracts on the blockchain. In Videlifedao, decisions made during live broadcasts are transmitted to all participants via the data channel and are transparently recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, members can confirm decisions through their web panel until the specified deadline.

We are presenting this project to Solana Foundation because of Solana's large community and its suitability for transparently recording community decisions on the blockchain. By making Meupwallet compatible with Solana, we aim to gain support from the Solana community and present our project in global hackathons.

Our project combines decentralized decision-making processes with live broadcast management, emphasizing transparency and participation. With the support of Solana Foundation, we believe our project will further grow and develop.

As new token trading becomes the hottest and most attractive domain for Web3 users, the low barrier to launching tokens and the sheer volume of new tokens have made trading more challenging. Existing AI tools fall short in providing effective support and actionable insight.

To address these challenges, our team—comprising AI experts, quant traders, and meme traders passionate about new token trading—has developed simple, easy-to-use, and effective tools. These tools help all crypto users identify high-potential targets and succeed in new token trading. In the long run, we aim to make the ecosystem healthier by enabling users to identify good projects and avoid malicious developers, creating a positive cycle.

What we are building: 

Phase 1. AR Copilot: A Large Language Model (LLM) trained on our exclusive Alpha database containing over 500,000 new token data, providing specific, actionable insights.
Phase 2. AR Intelligence: The most comprehensive database including 500,000+ Solana new token data where you can gain visual insights.
Phase 3. AR Trader: Allow users to preset trading criteria and enable auto-trading to seize on-chain opportunities 24/7.

We have strong AI and trading capabilities and feature engineering expertise that significantly enhance our models’ performance. As a result, our model provides significantly better and more actionable responses to crypto-related questions compared to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and IQ GPT.

1189,3,battleboosters,BattleBoosters,"BattleBoosters is a fantasy MMA NFT card game that offers players a thrilling, immersive experience based on real MMA league fights. It allows players to collect, trade, and compete using NFT Fighters and Boosters in a strategic, tournament-based environment.

How the Game Works:

1 - Acquiring NFT Fighters & Boosters

Players start by acquiring NFT Fighters through packs, which are priced at $125 for 5 NFT Fighters. Boosters, which enhance gameplay, are available for purchase at $1.25 each for  5 NFT Boosters.

Assets purchased through the official BattleBoosters website are immediately accessible in-game. However, they need to be minted on the blockchain if players wish to withdraw them. NFT Fighters acquired from external sources must be deposited into the game 
via the website to be usable in tournaments.


2 - Entering Tournaments:

With NFT Fighters in their collection, players can enter tournaments by navigating to the draft tab. Tournaments are categorized 
similarly to MMA league events into ""Early prelims,"" ""Prelims,"" and the ""Main card.""

          2.1 - For each fight in a tournament, players must select the fighter they believe will win the match. 

          2.2 - They then assign one of their NFT Fighters to represent that prediction, choosing a combat style that closely matches the actual fighter's style in the upcoming match.

          2.3 - Additionally, players can enhance their chances by assigning one booster per category: Points (points multiplier), Shield (increases the life of the NFT Fighter, reducing damage taken),


3 - Scoring and Damage Evaluation

After each tournament match, players can review the performance of their NFT Fighters and Boosters.

The scoring system evaluates both the number of points collected during combat and the damage dealt. Each fighter’s points are 
determined by correct fight predictions, while damage is calculated based on the fighter’s performance, including successful use of 
boosters. Players can analyze these stats to refine their strategies for future tournaments.


4 - Collecting Rewards

Once the tournament ends, players can check their rankings and claim rewards based on their performance. 

   Rewards include:
       - $SOL tokens
       - NFT Fighters
       - NFT Boosters
       - Champions Pass 


Conclusion

To achieve this, BlockBound leverages a decentralized approach to data management using a popular Javascript library.

Rather than relying on a central database to store all platform data, BlockBound allows users to store data locally on their devices. Data can be shared across devices on the network by setting up relays.

The sign-up process is simple and straightforward. Users can choose to sign up as landlords or renters. Once signed up, landlords can add their properties and invite tenants to those properties with ease. Sending an email invitation is all it takes for a tenant to become a part of the property.

Depending on the rent cycle set up for the property, tenants can make payments directly through the application. Additionally, landlords can make ad hoc payment requests to tenants as needed.

BlockBound is a fully decentralized application, ensuring that it is available anywhere without being reliant on server availability. This democratizes rental payment management for all users while protecting their personal data.""",2024-10-08T18:39:43.451Z,0,false,false,"[""Payments""]",Germany,https://github.com/Felix-Wagner-fw/blockbound,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

1629,3,borderless,Borderless,"Makes ICO GREAT again!

Imagine if companies around the world could hold a funding offer via their website just like an ICO did.

Hi, we are Borderless.company.

We are building tokenized company infrastructure.

[What]
The tokenized company is a hybrid coordination model of a legal entity and an on-chain entity.

A typical company that has a share like stock and membership could use this scheme to bring their shares onto the blockchain and unlock the opportunity to onboard millions of potential shareholders.

The tokenized company has the potential to revolutionize the traditional company operating model, but at the same time, it requires a very complex knowledge base.

[Problem]
Here are three main barriers that make share tokenization difficult.

1. Require in-depth knowledge of the law.
2. Require highly technical knowledge of blockchain and tokens.
3. UI/UX development for easy user onboarding.

[Solution]
How Borderless will solve these barriers and fill the gap between real-world companies and blockchain.

We'll provide three magical solutions here.

1.LETS (Legal Embedded Token Standard)
2.SCT (Smart Company Templates)
3.Borderless Apps

1. LETS (Legal Embedded Token Standard)

when the company trying to tokenize its shares LETS will serve the seamless tokenization experience while meeting the legal requirements of each country.

Now we cover two jurisdictions and two legal entity models.

DAO LLC JPN Token standard.
Swiss AG Token standard.

2. SCT (Smart Company Template)

Once the company decides to tokenize their shares, they have to optimize the operation agreement like articles of incorporation and other legal docs that define the company's operation rule. SCT provides a set of legal doc templates for each company model.

3. Borderless Apps

A variety of applications is provided for each jurisdiction to maximize the potential of LETS and SCT.

Here are some example apps that we are under development as a pre-set.

Estuary App → Tokenized share offering widget embeddable in the customer's channel. Demo (Japanese)

Launch App → No-code legalized on-chain entity set up.

Mint App → Issue the tokenized share with LETS.

Treasury App → Quick set up the digital bank account and wallet.

Governance App → Submit a proposal and manage role assignment.

[Go to market]
Now we are focusing on DAOLLC in Japan.

Since April, 22nd this year DAOLLC incorporation has been officially admitted by the Japanese government.

We've been involved in the process of the Japanese DAO law legislation as a team and also helped launch the Japan DAO Association, a self-regulatory organization.

We will incorporate the knowledge we have gained there into our products and provide them to users in Japan first.

[Traction]
The onboarding of the first customer(PR written in Japanese ) is almost complete and the pilot token sale is planned for the end of August.

We have received inquiries from many other customers and will accompany them to become a solid success story from a global perspective.

[Future Plan]
LETS and SCT can be applied to various legal entities in various countries. Working extensively with the Ethereum community and other synergistic projects, we will work on blockchain mass adoption worldwide through a tokenized company!

How We Achieve This:

1. Staking Instead of Liking:
Show Commitment and Compatibility: Users stake tokens to express interest in someone. A match occurs only if the other person stakes the same amount of tokens in return. With a daily limit of 100 tokens, this system emphasizes meaningful connections over casual swiping.

2. Robust Verification by Verifiers:
Ensure Authentic Identities: ByteLuv employs a Proof of Stake system for user verification, supported by Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) to prevent exploitation. This makes it exceptionally difficult for fake profiles or bad actors to infiltrate the platform.

3. Location-Based Random Matching:
Emulate Real-Life Encounters: Users are matched based on specific locations like cafes, libraries, or parks. You'll meet others in your vicinity in a random order, simulating the unpredictability and excitement of real-world interactions.

2014,3,dedocs,DeDocs,"Problem Statement:

Traditional document management systems lack transparency, are vulnerable to tampering, and struggle with secure remote signing. This leads to fraud risks, inefficient processes, and challenges in verifying document authenticity.

Why we're building DeDocs:

To solve this issue, we have built DeDocs, which is a Decentralized Document Management App built on Solana using Solana's React Native SDK. Our app leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for document storage, signing, and verification. We're revolutionizing critical document management for the digital age. Users can upload critical documents (e.g., property papers) directly to the Solana blockchain.

Document owners can designate signers using the signer's Solana wallet addresses during the upload process. Designated signers can see the document in their DeDocs app when logged in with their respective wallet addresses. The signers can view and sign the document with the help of a slider button after which their signatures will be recorded on the Solana blockchain, creating an immutable proof of signing.

The app displays the signing information, including the number of signatures (signed or not signed) and signer's details along with the signer's photo. Users provide a selfie upon first launching the app. Selfies are stored on IPFS, with their hashes recorded on Solana. This feature adds a layer of identity verification to the signing process.

The app showcases all user created and user signed documents so that they can easily track the status of document signatures. Signer photos are shown to uploader at the time of adding signers, so that there is some form of KYC as to who will be signing the documents.

Our target audience are individuals and businesses handling important documents, legal professionals, real estate agencies, financial institutions, and government entities. And our long-term vision is to establish DeDocs as the global standard for decentralized document management, streamlining workflows across industries and driving wider adoption of blockchain technology in everyday document processes.",2024-10-09T04:03:28.532Z,0,false,false,"[""DAOs & Network States"",""Consumer""]",India,https://github.com/Blaze5333/DeDocs,null,2,null,null,null,null,null

- Onboarding new users to crypto is the largest challenge we all have in crypto right now
- Memecoins are a great vehicle to solve this onboarding problem
- But it's a hassle to have fun with memecoins onchain: you have to set up a wallet, KYC and onramp all of which leads to a large % dropoff rate.
=>that's why I've built DegenDrop:


How It Works:
Popular memecoins get raffled daily to users for free
-for each raffle, we create and fund TipLinks (v1) with varying amounts of coins
-the TipLinks are then randomly assigned and sent to the users
-in v1 everything happens inside a telegram chat
-since telegram requires phone numbers, we can thus limit the sybil problem


How we Make it sticky:
- Make it the best arcade for users. Focus on Free Raffles + Simplest UX.
- Every round, N random users win a large payout of an assortment of Memecoins - with share button to CT to create engaging loop
- Notifications via Telegram messages for daily engagement",2024-10-09T03:26:28.337Z,0,false,false,"[""Payments"",""Consumer"",""Gaming""]",Germany,https://github.com/erikthedegen/degendrop,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

We empower artists, gallerists, curators, and collectors by providing tools for managing artwork, issuing digital certificates, and tracking provenance via NFTs.  By streamlining gallery operations and offering collectors a new way to manage and discover art, The Galeristas aims to bring the traditional art market into the digital age, creating lasting value for all participants.

While the art world is filled with creativity and innovation, it still needs to be updated regarding artwork, provenance, and sales. We address this gap by simplifying how artists, gallerists, curators, and collectors interact with one another.

The core of what we’re building is a system that provides galleries with tools to manage their inventory, track provenance, and offer collectors a way to manage their portfolios quickly. For artists, once a work is sold, they are cut off from any future value generated by that artwork, which doesn’t align with how value is treated in other creative industries like music or film. We use smart contracts to ensure artists can participate in their creative legacy. 

The global art market is estimated at around $65 billion annually, but most of that market activity happens in secondary sales, where neither artists nor galleries participate. This is where we believe The Galeristas can bring value—not by disrupting the market, but by creating tools that allow more players to participate in ways they haven’t been able to before. We’re focusing on building features that make sense for galleries and collectors first and then expanding those to artists who want more control over their work post-sale.

Why Solana?

By embedding itself more deeply into the art world, Solana can gain credibility as a reliable platform for managing high-value assets in creative industries. Blockchain adoption is still early in the art market. Still, the opportunity to become the go-to infrastructure for NFTs tied to physical assets—whether paintings, sculptures, or other art forms—is enormous. For Solana, becoming a trusted layer for creating and maintaining physical art NFTs creates a strong case for long-term adoption across new sectors.

Graph of Humanity is the only place on the Internet with real humans, where every real human is enrolled in a UBI program to get paid $ 1000 a month, and all this is secured by our very own  decentralized justice protocol. 

Simple comparison - 

Imagine Worlcoin on Solana, but one that actually delivers on the promise of UBI in the form of 1000 USDC to each person. 

Imagine Twitter & Facebook, except one that's hyper financial, 100% open source, has no bots & built from first principles to serve creators, not algorithms.

Imagine a digital version of the Supreme Court, except it's 100x faster, cheaper and decentralized. 

That's Graph of Humanity. 

In 5 sentences -

- Graph of Humanity is a maximally sybil-resistant graph of real human beings, which is a necessity in an age where it’s impossible to distinguish between humans and AI.

- We’ve built a decentralized, credibly neutral dispute resolution protocol called the “Decentropy Schellix Protocol”, which we use to verify the personhood of each account, where everyone can participate and earn from making correct judgements, and this on-chain dispute resolution justice system can be used for all cases that require human judgement, i.e, they can’t be settled with smart contracts.

- Vertically integrating the decentralized justice system with a graph of real human beings allows us to build powerful experiences and use cases (starting with a hyperfinancial social / creator platform) that uniquely leverage this to create lasting value within the graph.

- All value created within the graph is added to a programmatic treasury that no one controls, which distributes 90% of the eligible funds to every human who create this value every month, in the form of stablecoin USDC payments of 1000 USDC to each real human.

- 10% of the funds goes to the team to incentivise development and maintenance of the graph, leading to the first non-governmental, for-profit sustainable UBI distribution scheme.

iNFT reflects scarcity based on mathematical probability. The lower the probability, the higher the scarcity, or in other words, the greater its value. Even iNFTs of different themes (IPs) can be compared in value by their generation probability.

There are two important elements in the casting process of iNFT, one is the template (i.e. the gene of iNFT), and the other is the unique hash, which is the block hash of the blockchain. The implementation method is to read the corresponding data in the gene according to the values ​​of different positions of the hash, and splice the image of iNFT. This is the process of casting an iNFT in the PoW method.
Since the block hash is unpredictable and cannot be tampered with, the iNFT obtained is also unique and cannot be forged. According to the setting of the gene, the scarcity can be judged to form a decentralized value recognition, that is, the value of iNFT is determined by the block hash.

Our team members own a licensed financial company, which gives the NeBu team a significant advantage in terms of resources in the traditional financial industry compared to other Web3 teams. We are also in discussions to bring on a former JP Morgan Private Bank executive as an advisor to the project.

**Key highlights of NeBu:**

- Selected as one of the 13 winners out of approximately 150 applicants to join the accelerator co-hosted by SpringX and Solana.
- Awarded a grant by the Solana Superteam.
- Established partnerships with Pyth, OKX Web3, and Bitget.

With the help of local regulatory authorities and leading funds, the team is establishing such compliant investment channels in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Middle East. In the first phase, it is expected to provide:

- Malaysian Government Bonds - With the help of manager from leading national funds in Malaysia, we have mapped out the local compliance path.
- Singapore Bank Fixed Income - Provided by JP Morgan
- Middle East Infrastructure Products - Currently connecting with local regulatory authorities

Our solution, the Sustainable Loop, It starts with voting, where members choose LST for staking. From there, the community owner strategically allocates rewards to recognize and motivate contributors. 

# Problem
This is built on the Founder’s firsthand experiences with repeated community rug pulls and challenging MOD activities. DAOs and web3 communities face deep-rooted issues in structure and sustainability. Nizer is here to solve that.

# Progress
After Sanctum announced their Creator Coins, we were of course asked, including by Sanctum themselves, how our service is different. Issuing LSTs is just the beginning. We’ve listened to community managers who have issued LSTs and identified the real challenges they face beyond issuance. We’re building solutions to address those problems. When we presented this solution to Sanctum, they responded with, “Very good, I agree.”

# Output
The program is still in its early stages, but our team has engaged in extensive discussions to identify real challenges and craft solutions. We’ve documented this process in detail on our GitBook.

The protocol's DEX controller aggregates multiple sources of perpetual liquidity, allowing for permissionless rebalancing to optimize yield and manage risk effectively.

At the core of Reflect Protocol is the Autonomous Attestation & Risk Engine, which systematically assesses all relevant risk factors to produce an algorithmic risk score. This on-chain risk engine enables automated responses to key metrics such as funding rates and open interest percentages, setting a new benchmark for risk management in DEX-based DeFi environments.

Users can hedge their LSTs and earn yields in major global currencies, including US Dollars (USD), Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), and United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED).

1574,3,rena,ReNa,"Despite growing awareness, many individuals struggle to consistently adopt 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) practices due to a lack of motivation, engagement, and a clear understanding of their environmental impact. Recycling can be confusing with people often unsure how to identify and sort materials properly. Current recycling programs and platforms fail to provide sufficient incentives or community support, making it challenging to encourage active participation and foster lasting behavior change. 

RENA addresses these challenges by leveraging AI-powered image recognition and a work-to-earn model to incentivize recycling. The platform educates users through engaging content, including posters and resources that enhance recycling knowledge. Additionally, RENA collaborates with recycling organizations (NGOs) to create programs and campaigns that encourage active participation. All these features aim to build a vibrant and engaged community focused on sustainability and recycling. ReNa is not just an app—it's a movement towards a greener future where everyone can contribute, connect, and make a difference.Alignment with Sustainability Goals: The project promotes 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) practices, which align with Malaysia’s environmental sustainability goals. By encouraging recycling and reducing waste, it contributes to the national agenda of sustainable development.

Community Engagement: The project involves organizing community events, such as beach cleanups and recycled art workshops, fostering a sense of community and collective responsibility. This engagement helps in raising environmental awareness and building a supportive network around sustainable practices.

Innovative Use of Technology: Incorporating AI recognition for scanning recyclables and gamification features to earn points makes the project innovative. This aligns with Malaysia's push towards digital transformation and smart solutions in everyday life.

Educational Component: By providing workshops, educational booths, and interactive activities, the project educates the public about the importance of recycling and how to do it effectively. This education aligns with Malaysia’s goals to increase environmental literacy and awareness.

Youth Involvement: Engaging younger generations through mini-games and social media features attracts youth participation, which is crucial for building long-term sustainable habits. This fits into the Malaysia SuperTeam’s objective of fostering youth involvement in national development initiatives.

Scalability and Replicability: The project's model, including community events, AI technology, and gamification, can be scaled up and replicated across different regions in Malaysia.

2592,3,rheal-access,Rheal Access,"RhealAccess NFT Ticketing. This product uses the Solana blockchain as an accessible and secure database for multiple solutions, including:
• Event Ticketing. Ticketmaster is leading the market in an attempt to create a NFT-based ticketing system. After spending millions in development, they still don't have anything ready for prime time. Even if they succeed and capture the portion of the market they currently control, that leaves a sizable addressable market for the company to attack. NFT ticketing offers many advantages, including control by the ticketer for resell parameters--including the ability to prevent secondary sales and the automatic way to capture a portion of any secondary sales, whether an intermediary party (like Stubhub) is used or not. Turnkey solutions can be delivered to any type of customer of any size.
• Identification. Company identification systems are a huge market. We can deliver solutions that don't require physical badges. Employees can use an app on their phones that provides more security than current systems. This product can be used for similar systems, including driver licenses, passports, or other verified identifications. These NFTs can store any biometric information that customers may require. Capabilities can scale over time. The cost of this system is very low. We can create one billion identity NFTs for less than $100,000.
• Identity Fraud Elimination. Fraud can come from forged documents, such as property titles, and hacked vendor databases. Just this week, an article was published with the headline: ""Ticketmaster says customers' credit card information is affected by data breach"" (CBC, July 8, 6:37pm EDT). Any legal document can be placed on-chain with full validation and transfer controls. We can use an identity NFT as login credentials to safeguard consumers' information from a possible attack.
• Privacy Control. Perhaps the biggest drawback to using the blockchain for document storage is its public nature. The company can employ encryption and other proprietary technologies to protect any content (data, image, video, etc.) in these NFTs. This will give owners complete control over who can see these documents' contents. For example, you could show your property's title to a specific bank for a particular time period for an equity loan application and withhold the information from everyone else. Rules can be implemented to give law enforcement or other entities access under certain conditions.
• Value-Add. The tickets can be used to open other doors, literal or virtual. New ecosystems can be created before the event, during, or after. Digital collectibles and photos can be added or related to the ticket. Ticketers can send digital items directly to the ticket holders. This capability also applies to the Identification NFTs. For example, if my company has a group outing to a major league baseball game, these tickets can be distributed automatically and tied to company identification. The employees receive the tickets in their ID app, and the company will be confident that only those intended to use the tickets can access them.
• Communications. Issuers can use RhealAccess NFTs as a basis for secure communications with NFT holders. This capability can open many new valuable ways to narrowcast or do bidirectional messaging. For example, If I buy a ticket for a concert then resell it to a friend, the concert promoter can send communications directly to my friend to ask about their concert experience--all that without my friend needing to register on the promoter's website.",2024-10-09T04:54:03.737Z,0,false,false,"[""Consumer""]",United States,https://github.com/ceedeepee/RhealAccess,null,3,null,null,null,null,null

1282,3,seconds,Seconds,"Empowering savings through digital dollars and high-yield opportunities.

Throughout history, savings have symbolized financial security and stability. From ancient practices of hoarding precious metals to the establishment of modern banking systems, preserving wealth has always been a priority for the fortunate.

Yet, today, millions lack access to basic savings options. In many countries, people are excluded from financial institutions, and even where accounts exist, the returns often fail to keep pace with inflation. As interest rates decline, the potential for savings to serve as a reliable means of wealth preservation diminishes.

Instead of focusing on long-term financial security, individuals find themselves trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. With little room for error or unexpected expenses, many turn to trading memecoins in hopes of quick gains—only to face devastating losses that further erode their financial stability.

But what if we could change this narrative? Digital dollars offer a unique opportunity to transform how individuals save and grow their wealth. Unlike traditional savings accounts that yield minimal returns, digital dollars can provide higher yields through compounded interest, allowing savers to see their money work harder for them.


We are committed to making savings work for everyone. Our platform offers access to savings, high-yield lending, complex strategies used by professional traders, and investment opportunities in liquid assets and private companies.",2024-10-08T23:35:52.190Z,0,false,false,"[""DeFi"",""Payments"",""Consumer""]",Germany,https://github.com/shah-aman/seconds-fi-backend,null,2,null,null,null,null,null

	1.	A large number of Crypto natives do not trust the existing monetary/financial system, including the social insurance system, believing that such Ponzi-like designs are prone to collapse.
	2.	Regularly setting aside funds for retirement on the blockchain requires a high level of self-discipline, which many find difficult to maintain.
	3.	Many blockchain companies also need a social insurance solution for their employees that aligns better with crypto ideals.
	4.	In my view, network states will be the mass adoption phase of the blockchain industry, and on-chain social insurance will be a key piece in building these network states.

For these reasons, I first proposed and implemented the Social Insurance  On-chain product on social networks.",2024-10-09T07:03:53.608Z,0,false,false,"[""DeFi"",""DAOs & Network States""]",China,https://github.com/SocialInsurance,null,1,null,null,null,null,null

2239,3,solpipe,Solpipe,"Boost Validators and MEV Earnings with Solpipe.

MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) is a massive and growing market, but its potential remains untapped for most traders. Accessing and utilizing MEV currently requires sophisticated expertise and expensive validator infrastructure. This limits participation to a small group of specialized traders while validators struggle to fully maximize their earnings.

Solpipe's ""MEV Host,” a geyser plugin run by Validators, gives traders access to MEV on Solana. It's a specialized tool that allows trading bots to deploy directly in the validator, achieving the lowest latency possible.

Solpipe provides a decentralized auction for available workers in the MEV Host and connects traders directly to validators. Our approach allows traders to:

       * Deploy MEV bots without their own Validator:  Rent  a spot in a validator to run bot (written in a preferred language)
       * Access global validator networks: Connect to validators globally optimizing bots based on validator leaderboards.
       * Access Low-Latency Updates: Achieve real-time chain state by running their bot directly within the validator.

Solpipe empowers validators to:
       * Maximize validator earnings: Offer MEV hosting services and generate additional revenue from traders.
       * Increase network participation: Open your validator to a wider range of traders, contributing to a more diverse and active Solana ecosystem.

Solpipe is the key to unlocking the full potential of MEV on Solana, making it more accessible to a wider range of participants, and empowering both traders and validators to thrive within the ecosystem.

2091,3,solynx,Solynx,"What is a Decentralized Vercel or Web3 Firebase?
A decentralized version of Vercel or Firebase is a platform that offers similar features for deploying web applications but leverages blockchain and decentralized storage instead of traditional cloud servers.
In a decentralized Vercel, developers can upload, build, and deploy their static websites (or front-end apps) to decentralized storage networks like Arweave or IPFS. The deployment process mirrors how traditional cloud services like Vercel work, but instead of relying on centralized servers, it uses decentralized infrastructure. Similarly, a Web3 Firebase would offer features like real-time databases, authentication, and hosting but would utilize decentralized technologies, ensuring that data and hosting are spread across multiple nodes in a trustless, immutable manner.
The key features of these platforms include:
Decentralized hosting (Arweave, IPFS)
Decentralized domain resolution (ENS, SNS, or Unstoppable Domains)
Decentralized backend (blockchain smart contracts to manage logic, databases, and interactions)
Why is Blockchain Needed in a Decentralized Vercel?
Blockchain is needed in a decentralized Vercel for several reasons:
Immutable Storage: Blockchain ensures that deployments are tamper-proof, preventing unauthorized changes to code once it’s deployed. Every update is stored in a verifiable and auditable way.
Transparent Deployment History: Blockchain provides a transparent ledger of all deployments. Each version of your site can be traced, and you can roll back to any previous state using transaction history.
Decentralized Access Control: With blockchain, you can manage domain ownership and access control without relying on a central authority. For instance, ownership of an ENS domain can be verified on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring no single entity controls access to the domain.
Trustless Payments: Blockchain allows for decentralized payment mechanisms using smart contracts. Users can be charged for deployment services in cryptocurrency, allowing global, borderless payments with lower fees than traditional payment gateways.
Benefits of Blockchain in a Decentralized Vercel
Censorship Resistance: Because the content is hosted on decentralized networks (Arweave/IPFS) and the logic is managed by smart contracts on a blockchain, it’s nearly impossible for a central authority or government to take down or censor the website.
Security and Integrity: Blockchain ensures that once the website is deployed, it cannot be tampered with or modified by unauthorized parties. The deployment history is publicly available, and smart contracts can guarantee the integrity of the build process.
Ownership and Control: In a traditional cloud service, the platform provider has significant control over the hosting and deployment of applications. In a decentralized Vercel, developers fully own and control their deployments and domains via smart contracts, avoiding reliance on centralized authorities.
Global Accessibility: Blockchain ensures that anyone with internet access can verify the deployment and access the application, removing the need for central intermediaries, load balancers, or cloud providers that could have regional restrictions.
Cost Efficiency: With decentralized storage like Arweave, once data is uploaded, it is stored permanently, avoiding the recurring costs that come with centralized cloud providers. Blockchain-based payments also eliminate intermediaries, reducing fees.
By leveraging blockchain, decentralized Vercel provides a more secure, immutable, and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional cloud deployment platforms.

Many streaming platforms and creators depend on crowdsourced or crowdfunded support from their audiences. However, most crowdfunding solutions involve traditional payments, leading to challenges such as fraudulent donations & chargebacks, high fees from streaming platforms, and complications with international banking payments for different regions. Despite these major problems for nearly a decade, livestream crowdfunding is still largely successful. Some effort in has been made to PoC crypto payments for streamers, but are generally a low TRL score, and a market ready product to solve these problems for streamers is yet to arrive.

You can send a streamer a donation easily on Solana, (ex. twitch.gift/nickmura2), and a streamer can listen for these donation alerts on their livestream via OBS, which can be announced & notified live. Users can also customize their alerts TTS, and color/gradient to be displayed. Donations are handled via a custodial HD wallet (hierarchical wallet) and non-custodial withdrawals to enable both Web3 wallet transactions (Phantom, Glow) and mobile/external transactions sent from an exchange or external wallet.

- Tailwind compatible!
- Improved type safety.
- Adding helpful utilities for developers in the code to make it easier to do most common tasks.
- The latest version is built on The Web3JS 2.0 Build, Which brings the final bundle size from +700kb to only 32kb! And is highly performant.

To get the data right, some teams are investing in researchers or building tech infrastructure, which has a high cost with marginal return as the feature is not often directly money making, but is additive. Hence many of these orgs want to get the data from somewhere where it is their core business. 

Introducing The Grid, where our one and only focus is on providing neutral, highly accurate and structured Metadata about Solana projects. This means that data platforms can integrate a dataset directly and not worry about it again.

2402,3,zelf,Zelf,"Passkeys KILLER. MetaMask KILLER. Ledger KILLER.

Enough with the ""killer"" titles—let’s talk about the real potential behind what we’re building at Zelf.

At first glance, it might seem like we’re just developing another crypto wallet. But we’re doing something far more impactful. We’re aiming for mass adoption by providing everyone in the crypto space with a seamless way to secure their assets with ZelfProofs, while maintaining complete control over their data.

Here’s how Zelf works in 3 simple steps:

Pick your Zelf name – Users choose a unique name like miguel.zelf or john.zelf. This becomes their key to everything.

Create or import your wallet – With your Zelf name, you can either create a new wallet or import an existing one. Your ZelfProof—a privacy-preserving encrypted representation of your data—is created and stored as a QR code inside ZNS (stored on IPFS). No sensitive information is ever stored; only encrypted data is saved for your security.

Retrieve and interact – When you need to access your wallet, just search your Zelf name (john.zelf), and decrypt your ZelfProof with your face + password (optional). This allows you to retrieve your wallet’s 12-word phrase, interact with smart contracts, and once done, you can delete the decrypted content from your device, leaving no trace behind.

This simplicity is what’s capturing everyone’s attention—no need to remember seed phrases or deal with complex hardware wallets. You always stay in control, and with ZelfProofs, your data remains private and secure, safeguarded with powerful encryption.

Why Solana?

We see Solana’s speed and scalability as the perfect foundation to integrate ZNS and ZelfProofs into decentralized applications (dApps). By using ZelfProofs through ZNS, developers can provide users with seamless authentication and secure wallet management, while dApps benefit from frictionless logins, identity verification, and transaction signing, all without compromising security.

This solution is particularly effective for DeFi and NFT platforms, solving the challenge of balancing security with ease of use. With ZelfProofs, users enjoy passwordless, secure experiences, and developers get peace of mind knowing that sensitive data is never stored, only encrypted.

We’re also addressing broader challenges like multi-chain compatibility. Whether on Solana, Ethereum, or any emerging chain, ZNS and ZelfProofs enable secure, cross-chain interactions, allowing users to move assets and verify identities across blockchains—effortlessly.

For developers and enterprises, integrating ZNS and ZelfProofs offers new levels of security and ease for their applications, whether in DeFi, NFTs, or DAOs. For users, it’s a powerful, user-friendly way to manage their crypto without the complexity of traditional wallets.",2024-10-08T22:57:57.934Z,0,false,false,"[""Consumer"",""Infrastructure""]",Colombia,https://github.com/Open-Verifik/zelf-extension,null,4,null,null,null,null,null

Over the past few months, developers have created thousands of MCP servers, but there has been no way to monetize them. Latinum solves this by providing an MCP-compatible wallet that allows agents to pay for the services they consume.

Imagine using a tool like Cursor, which might rely on 10 different services, such as Figma or deployment platforms. Today, you’d have to register for each service manually, set up a subscription, and copy API keys into your MCP configuration. With Latinum, that friction disappears. Agents can manage their own budgets and make payments autonomously.

And this is just the beginning. In the coming years, most transactions—like ordering groceries or booking a ride—will be initiated by agents acting on behalf of humans.

Turning the world’s conversations into data

💡 Overview
oto is a voice data platform that captures real-world conversations through a wearable device and smartphone app. It turns speech into structured data to fuel AI. Users of major languages get personalized services like task automation and health insights. Speakers of underrepresented languages or accents can earn by contributing data. Like Google Trends for speech, oto aims to map how the world talks—securely and at scale.

😣 Problem
There is a global shortage of voice data for AI training.
- Out of approximately 7,000 languages worldwide, voice AI supports only around 150—meaning 98% of languages remain unsupported.
- Even in major languages like English, speech models still perform poorly with accents and dialects.
- Voice AI systems are still unable to engage in human-level natural conversation.
All of these limitations stem from a fundamental lack of high-quality, diverse training data.",2025-05-16T12:03:56.451Z,5000,false,true,"[""DePIN"",""Consumer Apps"",""AI""]",Japan,https://github.com/Heterod0x/oto,https://youtu.be/flhl91C01WY,3,"{""name"":""Honorable Mention - AI"",""type"":""HONORABLE_MENTION"",""track"":""AI"",""amount"":5000}",Honorable Mention - AI,HONORABLE_MENTION,AI,5000

3412,4,something.cool-and-cooldex.cool,Something.cool & Cooldex.cool,"Problem:
DEX trading today charges 0.25–5% in fees on every trade — then just adds that money back into liquidity pools. On Solana alone, over $1.4B has been locked into liq.pools of tokens that didn’t survive 2 hours. But those fees could’ve been redistributed differently — creating incentive for holders to stay, without placing additional costs on traders

Solution:
CoolDEX is the first-ever DEX that auto-distributes fees to real-time holders of the traded token — with no staking, no locking, and no dev-side control. Just hold = get rewarded.

For the first time in Web3, trading volume directly benefits the community behind the token — not just LPs.

Right now, only flippers win. 
With our tech, projects gain a base of loyal holders — reducing sell pressure and giving traders more confidence to play.
Both sides win. No value extraction.
